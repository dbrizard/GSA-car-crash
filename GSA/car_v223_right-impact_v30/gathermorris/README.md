# Compare the ranking given by Morris analyses

1. the `sortInd_R_Y.csv` files are written by `GSAutils.py` module:
  - `R` stands for the number of trajectories in Morris analysis,
  - `Y` stands for the name of the output;
2. run `gatherCSV.sh` to gather the `.csv` files,
  - this creates a new `indY.csv` file for each output;
3. these new `indY.csv` files can now be edited in LibreOffice:
  - additional information added (r=5, r=10, r=20),
  - conditional formating to better see the ranking for each Morris analysis (ie. for each column).
